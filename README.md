# nimbus
Repo for nimbus - a tool for controling jailbroken iDevices from SSH. Activator needed to work properly.
INSTALLING: Download the nimbus file and place it to /usr/bin by using iFILE or Filza file manager.
Controlling: type "nimbus help" in the on-device terminal emulator or from SSH for a list of commands.
I (SarKaa/Watking01) have added some flipswitch commands, like torch, hotspot, and more. I have also added a command for unlocking the device with the tweak passby, which should be installed from the bigboss repo in order for the unlock feature to work
